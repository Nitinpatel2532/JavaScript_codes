//1.) Introduction about Javascript....

// Javascript is a lightweight,interpreted,high-level programming language.primarily used for adding
// dynamic and interactive behaviour to the webpages.it is executed by the browser and works on the
// client-side.although server side environment is also possible using framework like(Node.js)

// 2.) Who created javascript.....

// Javacript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.initially it named was "MOCHA",later renamed to
// livescript,ECMAscript then finally to Javascript.T0day javascript is standardized under the name
// "ECMAScript" by ECMA international. this language was created to make webpages more
// interactive and dynamic.

//3.)  Why do we use javscript?

// 1.Interactive webpages => to create dynamic and interactive webpages (slider,form,dropdowns)
// 2.cross-platform => majorily supported by all modern web browser.
// 3.versatile => it can be used for both fronted (react & angular) and backend development(node.js)
// 4.DOM manipulation => load webpages in real time.
// 5.Rich ecosystem => lots of library.
// 6.Asynchronous processing => handle asynchronous task (AJAX calls)

// 4.) Usage of javascript

// 1.web development => adding Interactivity(form validations) and dynamic behavious using Dom.
// 2.web applications => single page application using react , angular
// 3.mobile application => using framework like React native,ionic
// 4.Backend development => server side scripting using node.js
// 5.Game development => using libraries like three.js
// 6.Desktop application => using framework like Electron.js
// 7.Data visualization => using libraries chart.js

// 5.) common framework and libraries.

// Fronted Frameork => React.js, Angular.js, Vue.js, Electron.js
// Backend Framework => Express.js, Nest.js, Node.js.
// Libraries => JQuery, char. js, three.js

// 6.) Types of javascript implementation

// 1.Client-side javascript => Runs in the browser to handle user interactions and dom manipulation
// eg. (form validation , animations , AJAX calls)
// 2.Server-side javascript => Runs on the server by using (Node.js) to handle Backend logic
// eg.(database operations, API handling)
// 3.Embedded javascript => Integrated with other languages or environment
// eg.(using javascript within HTMl <script> tags )

//7.) Server-side and Client-side language with advantage and disadvantage.

// 1.Client-side javascript => Runs in the browser to handle user interactions and dom manipulation
// eg. (form validation , animations , AJAX calls)

// advantage => 1.) Reduce server load as processing is done on the clinet side.
// 2.) immediate feedback to the user( form )

// Disadvantage => 1.) security risks as the code is visible to user.
// 2.) limited access to server resources.

// 2.Server-side javascript => Runs on the server by using (Node.js) to handle Backend logic
// eg.(database operations, API handling)

// Advantage => 1.) can interact with databasse and other resources
// 2.) secure as the code is executed on server

// Disadvantage => 1.)Increase server load
// 2.) slower response time as comparision to client-side.

// 8.) Uses of JS in web development
// 1. Dropdown-menu
// 2.Animated sidebars
// 3.Audio player
// 4.Video player
// 5.Calender
// 6.Form validations
// 7.maps
// 8.Pop-up windows  and many more...............
